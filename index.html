            My name is Stephen Pellegrini. I currently work in the IT department at Los Angeles
            Trade Tech College.
            </p>
            <p>
            After I finish the coding bootcamp at the UCLA Extension, I hope to get a job
            as a full stack web developer in Los Angeles.
            </p>

            I grew up in Orange County, California, in the city of Yorba Linda. In high school,
            I got my first exposure to computer programming in an AP Computer Science class. We
            learned Java, and I excelled. After high school, I attended UCLA where I studied 
            English Literature and Philosophy. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose a traditional, liberal arts education 
            because I believe the ability to think critically is one of the most essential skills
            in today's world.  In addition, through much practice with written and verbal communication,
            I developed strong analytical reasoning skills.  Even though I switched gears, these skills 
            are still applicable, and will surely benefit me in my quest to become a web developer.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently I live in Koreatown, in the City of Los Angeles.  My hobbies include hiking,
            traveling, and writing code!
